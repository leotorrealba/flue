## Synopsis

```bash
flue logs <workflowRunId> [--server <url>] [--follow|-f|--no-follow] [--since <eventIndex>] [--types <a,b,c>] [--limit <n>] [--format <pretty|json|ndjson>]
```

## Description

`flue logs` replays or follows events for one workflow run from a running Flue server. It is read-only and does not invoke work.

Runs are workflow-only. Direct HTTP or WebSocket agent prompts and dispatched agent inputs are persistent session interactions, not runs.

`flue logs` inspects runs owned by the selected running server. It cannot inspect the private child process used by `flue run` after that command exits.

## Arguments

| Argument          | Description                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| `<workflowRunId>` | Workflow run ID to inspect. |

## Options

| Option                            | Default                          | Description                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--server <url>`                  | `http://127.0.0.1:3583`          | Select the running Flue server base URL beneath which `/runs/<runId>` is published. May include an authored mount prefix. |
| `--follow`, `-f`                  | Automatic                        | Force live event streaming.                                                                                               |
| `--no-follow`                     | Automatic                        | Replay persisted events once and exit.                                                                                    |
| `--since <eventIndex>`            | Beginning of history             | Resume strictly after an event index.                                                                                     |
| `--types <a,b,c>`                 | All event types                  | Emit only the selected comma-separated event types.                                                                       |
| `--limit <n>`                     | Replay: `100`; follow: unlimited | Limit emitted events. Replay requests accept at most `1000`.                                                              |
| `--format <pretty\|json\|ndjson>` | `pretty`                         | Select human-readable or line-delimited JSON output.                                                                      |

When neither follow option is passed, `flue logs` follows active runs and requests one persisted-event snapshot for terminal runs. The snapshot endpoint is bounded: it returns the first `100` matching events by default and accepts a maximum `--limit` of `1000`. `flue logs` does not paginate snapshots.

Run routes may expose sensitive payloads, results, errors, and events. The current CLI does not accept authentication headers; use it only with a suitably protected and reachable inspection endpoint.

## Output and exit behavior

`pretty` writes human-readable events to stderr. `json` and `ndjson` are currently aliases: each writes one JSON event object per stdout line.

Request failures exit with status `1`. A failed workflow exits with status `2` only when its failing `run_end` event is consumed. Stream-framed server failures are not currently guaranteed to produce a nonzero exit status.

## Examples

```bash
flue logs run_01H...
flue logs run_01H... --no-follow
flue logs run_01H... --since 25
flue logs run_01H... --types operation_start,operation,tool_call,log,run_end --format ndjson
```
